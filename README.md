# Project Goal
The goal of this project is to:
Collect, preprocess, and analyze plant image data.
Build and fine-tune a CNN model for plant species classification.
Deploy the model into a web application where users can upload an image and get the predicted plant species.
1. Features
2. CNN Model : Custom CNN architecture for image classification.
3. Transfer Learning : Support for pre-trained models like VGG16, ResNet50.
4. Data Augmentation : Enhance training data with rotations, zooms, and flips.
5. Evaluation Metrics : Accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, confusion matrix.
6. Web App : Flask-based web application for real-time plant species identification.
