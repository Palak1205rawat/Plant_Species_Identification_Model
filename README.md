# Plant_Species_Identification_Model
🌿 Plant Species Identification Using CNN
This project aims to build a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to classify plant species based on images. It includes data preprocessing, model training using CNNs or transfer learning, and deployment of the model in a real-world application like a web app.

# Project Goal
The goal of this project is to:
Collect, preprocess, and analyze plant image data.
Build and fine-tune a CNN model for plant species classification.
Deploy the model into a web application where users can upload an image and get the predicted plant species.
🧠 Features
🌼 CNN Model : Custom CNN architecture for image classification.
🔁 Transfer Learning : Support for pre-trained models like VGG16, ResNet50.
📈 Data Augmentation : Enhance training data with rotations, zooms, and flips.
📊 Evaluation Metrics : Accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, confusion matrix.
🌐 Web App : Flask-based web application for real-time plant species identification.
