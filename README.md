# Project Goal
The goal of this project is to:
Collect, preprocess, and analyze plant image data.
Build and fine-tune a CNN model for plant species classification.
Deploy the model into a web application where users can upload an image and get the predicted plant species.
🧠 Features
🌼 CNN Model : Custom CNN architecture for image classification.
🔁 Transfer Learning : Support for pre-trained models like VGG16, ResNet50.
📈 Data Augmentation : Enhance training data with rotations, zooms, and flips.
📊 Evaluation Metrics : Accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, confusion matrix.
🌐 Web App : Flask-based web application for real-time plant species identification.

# Requirements
Make sure the following are installed:
Python 3.7+
TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch
OpenCV
Flask (for web deployment)
NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn
